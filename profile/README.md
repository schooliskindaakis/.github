## Joining or submitting content

Send a direct message to the [Instagram account](#links) or **submit your content** as an attachment to our [email](#links). 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We mostly operate via Instagram, so please include your preferred Instagram handle to your emails.
> Without one, we might *never* get back to you.

Accounts involved with the paper are followed and added into a group chat on Instagram.

Should you wish to stay **anonymous**, please inform us. Otherwise, you'll be credited within the paper with any two of your names.

## I submitted the content. What now?

There's not much of a process (yet), but here's the general idea:

1. A [curator](#available-roles) finally gets to reading all the emails and checking each one out.
2. Should the content interest us, someone on the [social media team](#available-roles) or a [curator](#available-roles) might reach out to you.
3. If you submitted something with text, you might be redirected to a [copy editor](#available-roles) who will read your work and correct any mistakes. Overall clarity might also be checked, to make sure your point comes across.
4. Once your content is ready, they'll go to the [graphic designers](#available-roles) to be added into the paper itself. You may be consulted as to how you want your content presented.
5. When the paper is published, your content will be on there! Yipee!

## Your rights

Now, we're not legal experts. But here's what we can give you:

- You will get *at least two of your names* as **credits**, unless you wish to remain anonymous. Tell us how you want to be credited.
- Your content won't be published until you give the "OK" to the designers. Except for minor visual edits, it will be **published as-is**.

> [!WARNING]
> Once the content has been published, we might not be able to take it down.
>
> The [license](#licensing) applied to the paper will also apply to your content as well.

## Roles

It's still new to all of us, so we're still figuring out what we need.

Right now, these are the roles:
- **Curators**: The curators choose what goes into the paper.
- **Content creators**: They write the articles and take the photos and make the art.
- **Copy editors**: English experts who work with the writers to correct grammar, spelling and overall clarity.
- **Graphic designers**: They take the content and format it for publication.
- **Social media team**: They control the Instagram and post stories and answer DMs.

## Wait, this is GitHub. What goes here?

GitHub is a code-sharing platform and utilises the version-control software called Git.

Originally, the idea was to make the paper fully website-based. However, that would heavily limit our creative capabilities, so the paper is instead made in a PDF format.

There will be a website for accessing all the issues of the paper as well as getting information on it. The information is temporarily here in the GitHub and will be replaced with a link to the website.

It's a pretty 'copyleft' license that promotes a lot of freedom in its usage, but still makes sure the original paper gets the recognition it deserves.
